<h1>Let's talk money</h1>
<h2>By Monika Halan</h2>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<ol>
    <li>We need a system, not a single shot solution.</li>
    
    <li>Setup efficient cash flow system.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Create 3 accounts, give them name or label, "Income", "Spending", "Savings". As soon as you receive salary (or any other source of income like Cash gifts, Bonus, Maturity, Rent, Dividents etc.) in the Income account, move a portion to Spending account for your expenditures (Example: Rent, EMI, Food, Fuel, Credit card bills, Utilities, Insurance premiums etc.) and remaining to Saving account. Spending account should be a joint account with your spouse. Never move money from Saving account to Spending account.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Rule of thumb: </b>Allocate 45-50% for Spending, 25-30% for EMIs and 15-20% for Savings.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li>Emergency fund.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Emergency fund should account for planned expenses such as New car, Car service, Kids school, Foreign holiday, etc and unplanned expenses such as Hospital bills, Job loss, Floods etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Rule of thumb: </b>Emergency fund should account for living cost for 6 months.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Where can you invest: </b> Flexi FDs, Smaller FDs, Short-term debt fund.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li>Protection.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Medical cover is more important than Life insurance. Probability("accident or death") is much less than Probability("Hospital").
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Price: </b> Premium increases as you age.
            </li>

                    <li>No disease waiting period</li>
                    <li>No sublimits</li>

            <li>
                <b>Claims: </b> 
                <ul>
                    <li>Claim ratio should be atleast 95%.</li>
                    <li>Claim to complaint ratio should be low.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Rule of thumb: </b> If you live in small town, 3 lakh per person, if you live in metros, upto 15 lakh per person.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Rule of thumb: </b> Have critical illness and personal accident cover for 10 lakhs, as standalone policy (not as rider).
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Where can you invest: </b> Refer Mint SecureNow mediclaim ratings. (Or, SIP in long-term product like balanced mutual fund with a target of 2X the cover.)
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Life cover.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Keep your investments and insurance seperate. Life cover should be only for death. Do not buy life insurance, if you are financially free (i.e., you already have saved a corpus that you can spend in your retirement).
                <ul>
                    <li>Buy a cheap plan.</li>
                    <li>Claim ratio should be atleast 95%.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Rule of thumb: </b> The cover should be 8-10x take home annual income or 15-20x annualized monthly expenditures. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Rule of thumb: </b> If you have loan, add a term cover for loan amount.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Investing.
        <ul>
            <li>Spend less, earn more or do both. There are different kinds of investment instruments like Gold, Fixed deposit, Real estate, Stocks, Mutual funds etc. Understand over what period of time an investment strategy works the best.</li>
            <li>Classify your expenses as near-term, medium-term and long-term.
                <ul>
                    <li><b>near-term: </b> Kids school, Purchasing home, etc;</li>
                    <li><b>medium-term: </b> Kids higher education/marriage, New car, Foreign trip, etc;</li>
                    <li><b>long-term: </b> Retirement, etc;</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Different investment instruments yield different results based on the risk associated with them.
                <ul>
                    <li><b>debt: </b> 7-8%; Examples: EPF, PF, PPF, FD, Bonds, Savings product, etc.</li>
                    <li><b>equity: </b> 12-15%; Examples: Stocks, Mutual funds, Exchange traded funds etc.</li>
                    <li><b>real-assets: </b> Examples: Gold, Silver, Real-estate, etc.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Rule of thumb: </b>Increase the allocation to debt based investment instruments as you age. Have 30% of your portfolio in debt when you are in 30s, have 70% of your portfolio in debt when you are in 70s.</li>
            <li><b>Tip: </b>Number of years to double your investment / 72 = Rate of interest.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
